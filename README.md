# eve-js-interface

Simple js library for interfacing with the ESI api for eve online

I originally built this for use in a solution for corporation buybacks and, as such, only has very limited resources. I'm actively working on updating its functionalities.

My current plans are to develop new features according to my personal priority, which is:
1. Finish Contract interface with better functionalities for corps
2. Corporation interface
3. Industry interface
4. PI interface

Apart from **1**, however, these aren't really high in my list of priorities so feel free to request new features if you find this useful.

I don't feel the interface is up to standard for publishing v1, so it is not yet available as an npm package. When that happens, I'll update the readme with instructions.

### In-Game Contact

My ingame contact is *Antara Daner*. Feel free to mail/message me if you find any issues. Alternatively, you can also do it through github.
